# DayandNight_simulation
My project is an OpenGL-based 2D animation depicting a cityscape with day and night modes, featuring moving elements like a bus, clouds, and birds. Users can toggle between scenes using keyboard inputs ('d' for day, 'n' for night), with dynamic updates handled by GLUT timer functions.

This output displays a colorful daytime with movable cityscape scene created using OpenGL. It features tall modern buildings, a pink bus on a road, flying birds, a traffic light, an air traffic control tower, and a bright yellow sun in a blue sky and clouds.

The output displays a night-time cityscape rendered in OpenGL, featuring tall buildings, a traffic light, and a moving bus on a road with dashed lines. A moon and stars illuminate the dark sky, while clouds drift across, and a control tower stands on the right. The scene is interactive, allowing users to switch between day and night modes.
