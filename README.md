# DayandNight_simulation
My project is an OpenGL-based 2D animation depicting a cityscape with day and night modes, featuring moving elements like a bus, clouds, and birds. Users can toggle between scenes using keyboard inputs ('d' for day, 'n' for night), with dynamic updates handled by GLUT timer functions.
